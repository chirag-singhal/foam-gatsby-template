# CTF (Capture The Flag) By Saurav Hiremath

Saurav introduced us to Capture The Flag events. These events consist of a series of challenges that vary in their degree of difficulty, and that require participants to exercise different skillsets to solve. Once an individual challenge is solved, a “flag” is given to the player and they submit this flag to the CTF server to earn points.

## Things Learnt

### Types of events

CTFs usually showcase different challenges that utilize or exercise specific areas of focus. Some popular areas of focus are:

- **Programming**
  - These types of tasks usually require some sort of programming to solve. In most cases, it will involve a mixture of programming and some reverse engineering.

- **Crypto**
  - These challenges feature common “real world” scenarios that often include the ever-popular ransomware type of malware.

- **Exploitation**
  - These tasks will force you to determine how to exploit (using buffer overflow, string format, SQL injection, etc.…) a given running process on the CTF target machine.
  
- **Reverse Engineering**
  - For tasks like this, reverse engineering will usually be required, for example, when the server sends you an executable.


### Steganography

Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection; the secret data is then extracted at its destination. The use of steganography can be combined with encryption as an extra step for hiding or protecting data.
