## Things Learnt

### Asynchronous Communication

- **Provide context**. Give your team member enough information to act on whatever you’re telling them.
- **Use screencasts**. If you have a lot to say, but don’t want to type it all out, record a video instead. Free tools like Soapbox allow you to capture your video for free, and give you a link that you can post directly in Slack.
- **Avoid @ mentions unless necessary**. While at mentions are great at ensuring that someone reads your message, it can demand the target’s attention immediately. If your message is non-urgent, consider posting directly to a channel where you know they’ll see it.

### Meetings

- **Asking Why?.** 
  - Does this need to be a meeting. Is there another way to accomplish this?
- **Agenda** 
  - Make sure to have an agenda and context for the meeting and make sure its followed.
- **Actions**
  -  Make sure every meeting ends in actions. 
- **Documentation**
  - Make sure to document the meeting so that you remember what happened in the meeting. Also, other people can benefit from the meeting who weren't there.
